# Interview Preparation: Load Forecasting Project

This document provides a comprehensive set of interview questions and detailed answers that may be asked about this load forecasting project. It covers all phases: data preprocessing, model selection, training, prediction, evaluation, deployment, and explainability.

## 1. Project Overview

**Q: What is the objective of this project?**
- The goal is to forecast electrical load for different regions (e.g., DELHI, BRPL, BYPL, NDMC, MES) using deep learning models. Accurate load forecasting helps utilities optimize power generation, reduce costs, and improve grid reliability.

**Q: What data is used for forecasting?**
- The project uses time-series data containing historical load, weather features (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and time-based features (hour, day, month, weekday).

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing

**Q: How is the raw data prepared for modeling?**
- The data is loaded from CSV, with the 'datetime' column parsed and set as the index.
- Categorical features like 'weekday' are converted to numerical values.
- Time-based features (hour, day_of_week, month, is_weekend) are extracted.
- Lag features are created for each target (previous hour and previous day values).
- Missing values are handled using forward fill and imputation (median for numerical, most frequent for categorical).
- Data is split into training and test sets before scaling to avoid data leakage.
- Features and targets are scaled using `StandardScaler`.

**Q: Why are lag features important in time series forecasting?**
- Lag features provide the model with information about previous values, helping it learn temporal dependencies and patterns in the data.

**Q: How do you handle missing values?**
- Forward fill is used for time-series continuity, and scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer` is used for robust imputation in pipelines.

## 3. Model Selection and Architecture

**Q: Which models are used and why?**
- GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM models are used because they are well-suited for sequential data and can capture long-term dependencies in time series.

**Q: What are the differences between GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM?**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** Simpler, fewer parameters, faster to train, good for moderate dependencies.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** More complex, can capture longer dependencies, often more accurate.
- **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM):** Processes data in both forward and backward directions, useful when the entire sequence is available.

**Q: How do you choose the best model?**
- Models are compared using metrics like MAPE, RMSE, and R² on the test set. The model with the lowest MAPE is typically preferred for forecasting accuracy.

---

## 4. Model Training

**Q: How is the model trained?**
- The model is trained using Keras' `.fit()` method with early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpointing, and TensorBoard logging.
- Training and validation losses are monitored to prevent overfitting.

**Q: What callbacks are used and why?**
- **EarlyStopping:** Stops training when validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting.
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Reduces learning rate if validation loss plateaus, helping the model converge.
- **ModelCheckpoint:** Saves the best model during training.
- **TensorBoard:** Enables visualization of training metrics and model graphs.

**Q: How do you handle overfitting?**
- Early stopping, validation split, and regularization techniques (if used) help prevent overfitting.

## 5. Prediction and Forecasting

**Q: How are predictions made?**
- Features are scaled using the saved scaler, reshaped for RNN input, and passed to the trained model. Predictions are then inverse-transformed to the original scale.

**Q: How is multi-step (future) forecasting handled?**
- The model predicts one step at a time, updating lag and time features for each new prediction, and iteratively forecasting the desired number of steps (e.g., next 24 hours).

**Q: How are results saved and visualized?**
- Predictions are saved as CSV files, and forecast plots are generated using matplotlib for each target region.

---

## 6. Evaluation and Metrics

**Q: Which metrics are used to evaluate model performance?**
- RMSE, MAPE, R², MAE, Max Error, Median Absolute Error, Explained Variance, MSLE, Poisson Deviance, and Gamma Deviance.

**Q: Why is MAPE important for this project?**
- MAPE expresses error as a percentage, making it easy to interpret and compare across regions and models.

**Q: How are evaluation results visualized?**
- Bar charts and heatmaps (e.g., for MAPE) are generated for easy comparison. True vs. predicted plots are also created for each target.

---

## 7. Deployment and Scalability

**Q: How can this model be deployed in production?**
- The trained model and scalers can be loaded in a web app or API for real-time or batch predictions. TensorFlow/Keras models are portable and can be served using TensorFlow Serving, Flask, or FastAPI.

**Q: How do you ensure scalability and maintainability?**
- The code is modular, with clear separation of data processing, training, prediction, and evaluation. Pipelines and saved artifacts (models, scalers) enable easy retraining and updating.

---

## 8. Explainability and Reporting

**Q: How do you explain model results to stakeholders?**
- Use interpretable metrics (MAPE, RMSE, R²), visualizations (plots, heatmaps), and clear documentation. The `EXPLAINABLE_RESULTS.md` file summarizes model comparison and metric meanings.

**Q: How do you document the learning process?**
- Each phase (preprocessing, training, prediction, evaluation) is documented in detail in markdown files, making the workflow transparent and reproducible.

---

## 9. Advanced/Follow-up Questions

**Q: How would you improve the model further?**
- Try more advanced architectures (e.g., attention mechanisms, transformers), feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or ensemble methods.

**Q: How do you handle concept drift or changing data patterns?**
- Regularly retrain the model with new data, monitor performance, and use adaptive learning techniques if needed.

**Q: What are the limitations of this approach?**
- Deep learning models require large amounts of data and may be less interpretable than traditional models. They can also be sensitive to data quality and require careful preprocessing.

## 10. Code and Tools

**Q: Which libraries and tools are used in this project?**
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle, and standard Python libraries.

**Q: How is reproducibility ensured?**
- Random seeds are set for data splitting, and all preprocessing steps are saved (scalers, pipelines). Models and results are versioned and saved to disk.

**Tip:**
- Be ready to discuss specific code snippets, design decisions, and trade-offs made during the project.
- Practice explaining both the technical and business value of your solution.
