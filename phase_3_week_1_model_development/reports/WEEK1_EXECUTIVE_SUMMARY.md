4. Create ensemble methods combining best performers

**Performance Targets for Week 2:**
- LSTM/GRU: < 6% MAPE
- Transformer: < 5% MAPE  
- Final Ensemble: < 4% MAPE

### Data Quality Assessment

**Features Used:** 110 selected features
**Training Period:** 70% of available data
**Validation Strategy:** Time-series cross-validation
**Target Variables:** 6 (Delhi Load + 5 DISCOMs)

### Critical Success Factors

✅ Baseline establishment successful - Ready for Week 2
